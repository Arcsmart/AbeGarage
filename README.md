AbeGarage - Full-Stack Auto Repair Management System


"AbeGarage" is a full-stack web application built to bridge the gap between customers and auto repair shops.
It provides a transparent, digital-first platform where users can easily find mechanical services tailored specifically to their vehicle





 About The Project

 
The goal of this project was to solve a common problem in the auto repair industry: the lack of a clear, immediate way for customers to know which services apply to their specific car. "Garage" addresses this by allowing a user to enter their vehicle's Make, Model, and Year, and in return, see a comprehensive list of all applicable mechanical services.
This application is built with a classic separation of concerns: a modern frontend built in React that communicates with a dedicated backend API built with Node.js, Express, and MySQL.
