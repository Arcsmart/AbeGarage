AbeGarage - Full-Stack Auto Repair Management System


"AbeGarage" is a full-stack web application built to bridge the gap between customers and auto repair shops.
It provides a transparent, digital-first platform where users can easily find mechanical services tailored specifically to their vehicle





 About The Project

 
The goal of this project was to solve a common problem in the auto repair industry: the lack of a clear, immediate way for customers to know which services apply to their specific car. "Garage" addresses this by allowing a user to enter their vehicle's Make, Model, and Year, and in return, see a comprehensive list of all applicable mechanical services.
This application is built with a classic separation of concerns: a modern frontend built in React that communicates with a dedicated backend API built with Node.js, Express, and MySQL.

 Key Features

 
Vehicle-Specific Service Engine: A core feature that dynamically filters a comprehensive service list against vehicle data to ensure accuracy and relevance for the user.
Relational Data Model: Utilizes a MySQL database with a normalized schema to maintain data integrity between customers, their vehicles, and potential service histories.
RESTful API: A well-structured API provides clear endpoints for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to services, vehicles, and user information.
Component-Based UI: Built with React, the user interface is composed of reusable components, making the codebase clean, maintainable, and easy to scale.
Responsive First Design: The UI is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience whether the user is on a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.
